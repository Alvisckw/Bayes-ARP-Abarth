      "Author: jkbenn02\n",
      "Text: TLDR: FCA part number 68228884AD uses the same brackets as Abarths. \n",
      "\n",
      "Warning…I’m used to long forum posts so forgive the rambling. Also another warning, the fogs aren’t installed yet. \n",
      "\n",
      "After successfully installing NHK Gen V bi-led headlight projector assemblies in my 2013 Abarth I wanted to complete the lighting package with proper LED fog lights. I had tried just bulbs (in the headlights) but I knew it wouldn’t provide good lighting and while also knowing that it would likely make me a menace to society riding around with light going everywhere.  At least I could confirm personally that they sucked. And they did.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I say proper because far too many people are just swapping bulbs which just isn’t right. Shitty beam patterns…regardless of how much they claim that “my $50 led bulbs are great”. 🙄trust me..they aren’t great. They may be brighter than halogens but the pattern is horrible even if you clock the bulbs in every direction. \n",
      "\n",
      "Anyways, I split the headlights via baking and installed the LED projectors in place of the original halogens using various adapters. It was a lot of work and well worth the effort. Now the  headlights are just amazing and on par with my Tesla 3 which are extremely good. I used aftermarket Depo headlights as I didn’t want to deal with the OE permaseal. It was still a painful process (hot headlights are no fun to open). At least this way I could take my time as the car still had the headlights in place. \n",
      "\n",
      "On to the main topic, the fog lights:\n",
      "\n",
      "SURELY I’m not the first person to notice this but I haven’t seen anyone else post this before. These cars have been out for over a decade and the community is pretty damn good especially when it comes to modding them. \n",
      "\n",
      "Anyways, I wanted to share this with you all. Despite all those out there claiming no replacements exist I believe I can prove otherwise. \n",
      "\n",
      "I think we can all agree that the Abarth fog assemblies have a distinctive look to them when removed. So off to eBay I went. A quick cross reference of the oe part number showed a number of the other FCA cars that used the same assembly. This gave me hope 🤣\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I backed out that part number from my search and just put “LED Fog dodge” (or other brand such as Jeep) and you will quickly see factory LED fog lights that look almost identical to the Abarth fog lights. I could have stopped there and thrown those into my bumper but I wanted something better.  So if you want LED bolt in fog lights just stop here. For around ~$60 you can’t beat them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I bought a cheap set of LED fog lights on eBay (part number 68228884AD) to compare to the Abarth’s fogs. I couldn’t tell a difference between the Abarth and Jeep brackets so I took the next step of getting Morimoto XB fog lights (part number LF620). These are marketed for all those other FCA models previously mentioned but no 500 Abarth at all but it only took me a few small leaps to make the “connection”)\n",
      "\n",
      "If going the aftermarket OE route, just install them as delivered. I can’t comment on the wiring for those but the plug looks the same between the OE abarth H11 plug and the aftermarket OE style led. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’ll be installing the Morimotos soon so I’ll update this if there are any issues. Even if some type of resistor is needed that is still not a big deal. \n",
      "\n",
      "NOTE: The reflector on the aftermarket OE style are going to be about 3/8” shorter compared to the original fog lights BUT the chrome trim rings appear to be the same depth so there shouldn’t be a larger gap or anything like that. \n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps I’m missing something mounting-wise and nobody is talking about it but I think this is a good solution for inexpensively upgrading your fogs to LEDs for about the same price as doing it the wrong way (just installing led bulbs into your halogen housings)\n",
      "\n",

Aaaand, proceeded to dump most of the transmission fluid on the ground due to a bad seal on the transmission cooler. Replaced that, refilled the transmission (it's a PITA on the Automatics) and was able to drive it around the neighborhood without incident! Still need to put the front bumper back on and then get it inspected, but we're closer than we've been in a while!\n",

I know it's a long shot, but I was wondering if there was anyone here near Indy (Garfield Park more specifically), that would be willing to go check it out and let me know if they think is even worth pursuing. Not looking for a ppi or any guarantee, just an educated eye that could let me know if it's decent, and maybe get a feel for the dealer, they don't have the most glowing reviews. Of you think you could help send me a pm and we can discuss things, including compensation. Thanks.\n",

      "Author: APB3\n",
      "Text: I asked: \n",
      "\n",
      "I have a turbocharged car. Many companies sell insulating \"blankets\" for the turbocharger such that the heat on the hot side of the turbo becomes hotter and the intake charge on the cold side of the turbo becomes colder. As a result, power is increased. I'm not doubting that this is true, but I have a concern: by forcing the turbo to become hotter isn't it at risk of premature failure? The companies that make these blankets deny this, but I still worry.\n",
      "\n",
      "It replied:\n",
      "\n",
      "The use of insulating blankets on turbochargers can increase power output by reducing the amount of heat lost from the exhaust gases as they pass through the turbocharger. This reduces the amount of heat that is absorbed by the engine bay and the surrounding components, which can help to lower intake air temperatures and increase engine efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, you are right to be concerned about the potential impact of increased temperatures on the turbocharger itself. Turbochargers are designed to operate within specific temperature ranges, and excessive heat can cause premature wear and failure of the turbocharger.\n",
      "\n",
      "The manufacturers of these insulating blankets may deny any negative impact on the turbocharger, but it is important to understand that any modification to the turbocharger, including the use of insulating blankets, can affect its performance and longevity. The risk of premature failure may depend on factors such as the quality of the blanket, the operating conditions of the turbocharger, and the maintenance and care of the engine and turbocharger.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you are considering using an insulating blanket on your turbocharger, it is important to do your research and choose a high-quality product that is designed specifically for your turbocharger model. You should also consult with a trusted mechanic or tuner who has experience with turbocharged engines to evaluate the potential risks and benefits of using such a product.\n",

      "Author: dZisky\n",
      "Text: Hello all! My cat got lucky today because my gf Abarth (2011 European 595C) didn't start when we wanted to go for the vet appointment. When I turned the key, I heard rapid clicking sound (sounded like relay), but nothing was happening, the alternator didn't even try to start the engine. On the next try, I also saw errors on the screen \"check gearbox\" (it is automatic) and \"power steering error\". On the next try, the screen also got very dark couldn't almost read anything from it, so it looked like a dead battery. I popped up the hood, checked the battery clamps, and a positive one was a bit loose (not totally loose, but I could twist it with my hands). So I thought that was the problem, went home, got some tools and a multimeter. Tightened the clamp and checked the voltage on the battery it was showing 12.00V, so not a dead battery as I initially thought, but after tightening the clamp still the same issue - won't start, throws lots of errors. So I also disconnected and reconnected ECU connectors and checked the error codes with the ODB scanner. It showed a lot of errors, but they all seem quite random, can't see any root cause there (full list [here](https://gist.github.com/DavidZisky/6b1f5c4760c34a3d0fe1c8c668f29b47)). So it looks like some weird \"everything is wrong\" electrical error. I know how to fix cars and what to check next, but I'm new to Abarth, so I'm asking here if there is any common/well-known issue that would cause such symptoms?\n",

      "Author: IHeartOurContinent\n",
      "Text: Hello, I'm an owner of a Spider Abarth 124. Bought it three years ago. I now wonder if I just need to dump the car. It's my first ever car, I'm an NYC local and got my license about three months before I got the car. Cars are still an alien concept to me, particularly the mechanics. It's a great car to learn how to better drive with, but I hit a curb and now the alignment is off. I've been stuck in mechanic hell for the last week. I have a new job in FL and I'm in Los Angeles now. I have to get it shipped out by Wed. I keep having to order new parts. First the rims. That showed up. Shop owner at Pepboys said he had my tire. He didn't. They ordered, guarantee a day for tire to show. Three days later, no tire. So i towed it to another mechanic. It's Friday. He won't look at it til Monday. I need new suspension I was told. So if he looks at it Monday, will he tell me I need all these weird parts for the suspension that no other mechanic has and I have to order? Or is there a reasonable expectation this can be fixed in a day? I am buying a run flat that works tomorrow. I am hoping Monday morning, he has tires, rims, and can have my car ready Tuesday night. I don't need a ton of fixes. I really need the tire and rim on there so it can be in decent enough shape to be shipped.\n",
      "But is even that unrealistic? And how much is suspension fix? I set aside 5k for the whole fix. I don't speak car language, I'm so ovweherlmed and while I tried getting help last Monday, I've faced a series of delays of not having parts, parts promised they'd ship quickly, they don't, and my car just sits there. Do I just toss the damn thing? Guy at shop offered me 1,500. Seems low. It's been all around the continent and handled tough terrain. It has 80k miles on it and has been to 15 states in Mexico, 20 in the US and four provinces in Canada. I've taken it through many long 6 minth road trips across North America. Wondering if it's time to say goodbye, or if you guys could help, tell me what questions to ask and how to be aggressive enough to get car fixed in a timely manner. Thanks\n",

The next time I started it (to go get the code scanned) the idling was smooth but the CEL was still there. The code it was throwing was a faulty/dirty MAP sensor. So I replaced that, and for a car that has only 18k miles, that MAP sensor was filthy. Yesterday, I started the car up and had another CEL and it was idling rough like the last time but this time I took it straight to a store and had it scanned. This time I got one code with no definition and another saying cylinder #4 was misfiring. I started the car back up after scanning, and it was idling smooth and sounded fine.  \n",
      "The conclusion me and a buddy have come to is I need to replace the coils and spark plugs. Also, maybe this is why the MAP sensor was so dirty, because it just wasn't burning hot enough? What do you guys think? Also what brand would you recommend for coils and plugs?\n",

When idling the car sputters just a bit. It isn't a drastic sputter, but definitely enough to notice. I was able to drive the car back home. It actually drive just fine, accelerates fine, and drives normally at speed but the boost is worrying me. I'm making a lot more boost relative to rpm than is normal. When cruising at 55mph before this CEL, you guys know that the boost gauge should be practically sitting at the bottom of the gauge. But now it's at about 4-6psi at about 2-2.5k rpm. It's very odd. This is my first ever turbocharged car, so I really don't know what could have gone wrong to throw this CEL and cause these symptoms. I'm going to have it scanned at an autozone today but I wanted to get some opinions from some other Abarth owners as well.  \n",

      "* Driving home on one hour drive via highway.\n",
      "* Two miles before home, dash \"battery charging system light\" (battery icon) goes on/off approx. every 15 seconds\n",

      "* 1/2 mile before home both lights remain solid and not randomly blinking on/off.\n",
      "* Pull into local garage which is open. Engine begins sputtering a bit.\n",
      "* Negative cable on battery was a bit loose (I had switched battery myself 6 months ago). Mechanic tightens negative battery cable to battery. Car turns off (I believe we turned off engine and it didn't stall)\n",
      "* Car will NOT turn back on. Car has power but engine is not cranking.\n",
      "* EDIT (added): Battery is checked and is outputting proper voltage.\n",
      "* Mechanic checks for codes which supposedly resets the computer system in the process. I recall him saying multiple codes were showing up and to leave the car. Tech believes it's the starter since the engine won't crank.\n",
      "* Mechanic calls - says the starter needs to be replaced. Cost $600 USD w/ labor.\n",
      "* Mechanic calls - starter replaced and apparently needed replacement, however it did not fix the issue.\n",
      "* They are now getting a code pointing to the alternator so they are testing the alternator for improper voltage.\n",
      "* Mechanic believes it could be the alternator but hoping it's not the ECU.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Notes:** Car has a 500 Madness ECM piggyback as well as a GoPedal.\n",
      "\n",
      "My questions for the experts here is does the diagnosis so far seem correct? I really don't want to go bankrupt trying to get my beauty fixed if I should be going to a different mechanic who specializes in Fiat. I'm concerned they will repair the alternator and then tell me it didn't fix the issue and loop will continue. The closest Fiat dealer from me is 20 miles away and I would need to have it towed there since the car won't start.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, I am 8 miles west of Boston. If anyone is in this area and swears by their mechanic, I could use any recommendations for either this or future repairs. Thank you for reading and any assistance.\n",
      "\n",
      "**UPDATE 1/20/23:** Mechanic called and new starter was broken. Tried another one - also broken. Tested both starters outside of the car and they work. Tested my original starter outside of the car and **IT WORKED**. Put starter back in my car and would not turn on. Apparently, there is a tricky way regarding the wiring to power the starter which was not set correctly. Once this was figured out after several phone calls from my mechanics to others, the car turned on without issues! He replaced the negative terminal to the battery as apparently it was having trouble staying tight.\n",
      "\n",
      "With that said, we will do not know why the car would not turn back on when I originally brought the Abarth to the mechanic with the two dash lights on. I do believe those two lights originally went on from a loose negative terminal to the battery. However, after tightening the negative terminal and clearing out the ECU's codes, the car should have cranked the starter and turned on but it did not. My only guess is there was some sort of safety initiated that prevented the clutch sensor or ignition sensor from allowing the starter to crank? I'll be keeping an eye on it over the next week to see if anything odd occurs but crossing my fingers.\n",

I have found and fixed a few things already but this week I have started to notice a burning plastic smell.  Definitely plastic and NOT rubber or oil.  I can only think that it's clutch or brake related but I haven't been able to narrow it down to either just yet.  I don't smell it on a drive until I come to a stop but both clutch and brakes are being used at that time.  Other than those, I also had the heated seats on and would notice the seats were getting warmer when the smell would come up.  If it were the seats, I would imagine I'd smell it while cruising, but only happens at start/stop at an intersection.  \n",

My car is modded and tuned and normally hits 25lbs from 2nd onwards. When it holds 18psi it’s constant and fine, no issues, and same when it hits 25lbs in 4th. So I’ve determined it can’t be a boost leak, and if my actuator wasn’t set properly it would only hold the same amount of boost through all the gears correct? And if my actuator was faulty it would be overboosting quickly. I recently replaced all the turbo vacuum lines with red silicone ones and zip tied the connections, which I do plan to replace with spring clips, but even so, if those were leaking that doesn’t explain the 18lbs in 1,2,3 and then holding 24 in 4,5 gear.

Scouring the internet, the closest resemblance I can see with body kit option, is in the 2021 euro catalogue where they had a bodykit based on the Anniversario 70th edition (same as the Biposto I believe, with the flared wheel arches).

      "Text: So my dad and I have the turbo stupid idea of building an engine for my abarth. The engine in it is fairly ok still, it just has signs of poor maintenance history from the previous owner that are showing up. The reason we'd be building it is to get more power and because we're either going to rebuild this one or build a new one. Preference on building a new one so the car is still drivable at all times until the swap is done. If I do that I'd probably plop the bigger turbo, FMIC and put the works in the engine. I am not precisely sure what that entails, but something in the vein of better pistons, cam, block, bottom and top end if possible. So I was wondering how expensive people think that'd be because my guess would be somewhere close to 10k especially if I do better block. Apologies in advance since this isn't the most thorough idea or concise.\n",

As some of you may know we launched Euro2ner.com as a parts seller that caters to this community among other Italian cars. I've come to find that the majority of vendors don't list part numbers or outright Photoshop them off the items. This is to protect their pricing scheme but at the end of the day it makes it so much harder to find replacement parts that came as a set or takes away the ability to cross shop and consider alternatives. We see this on any number of items, the most offensive being the \"big injectors\" being sold for the US Abarth. These are Bosch PN 0280158117.... Go ahead and try to find that info on any vendor page listing the big injectors for sale... Insult to injury is if you had one fail on you, you're out of luck trying to find an individual replacement without reaching out to a vendor who may or may not want to sell you an individual part. On all listings on our site, we're going to include OEM Part numbers so you can find these for yourself if need be. Thank you\n",

      "Text: Has anyone had any luck importing an Abarth 595 to the states?  Or even know who to contact about it?  I had an Abarth 500 that I loved and sold on 2017 never imagining I wouldn’t be able to get another one.  (We had taken in a relatives newborn and his car seat wouldn’t fit in the backseat).  Now we can’t buy them here, in fact the US seems to be getting rid of all their hot hatches. I got brand new VW Golf in 2021 but it’s no where near as fun as the Abarth was.  I hit a deer with it and I’ve been a rental for almost a year now.  Buying another new VW GTI or R is proving to be very difficult they don’t have them anywhere and I’d rather have the Abarth anyway\n",

I have a single lane driveway and didn't feel like playing musical cars for a few weeks, so it sat. But now when I try to start it, it just cranks and cranks. I can hear sound from the exhaust, so the motor is definitely spinning: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uba-PtlEiC8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uba-PtlEiC8)\n",

It's there right now and I didn't snap any pictures of the side skirts before dropping it. But they are coming off the car, I think because of how rough the dude was about loading it onto the trailer and unloading it. I'm not too happy about that, but it should be an easy enough fix. My question is, what's the best tape/glue/ whatever to use to stick em back onto the body? I would imagine it's a pretty straight forward fix, but will there be any need for anything like a heat gun or any other tools? Thanks!\n",

      "\n",
      "I discovered during my regular checks during a fill-up that the dipstick was dry. It's always been very difficult to get an accurate reading because the Euro Platinum is too clear and clean in my car. I got around this problem by rolling the dipstick on a clean shop wipe and matching the stain with the dipstick.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also believe the oil left inside the dipstick tube stil manages to coat the dipstick when pulled out the second time, giving me a false reading that the engine is topped off. I suspect my car has always burned a bit of oil, but the dipstick always had a coating of oil because of the oil left in the dipstick tube screwing things up.\n",
      "\n",
      "I found a way to read the oil accurately with only one extra step. The first and third steps are the same (pull out, wipe clean, reinsert, pull out, read), but the second step involves reinserting the dipstick until it hesitates. Instead of pushing the dipstick all the way in, you pull it out and wipe again. That cleaned out any oil left in the dipstick tube, and no extra oil was dragged into the dipstick tube.\n",
      "\n",
      "After I added a quart of oil a bit at a time and tried my technique to confirm the oil level was coming up, applying the dipstick on a shop wipe revealed the oil level was back to the top of the mark, and no oil was present on the skinny part of the dipstick after the top mark.\n",
      "\n",
      "Worst case scenario is my car ran on 3 quarts of oil for a while. But as Tyler Hoovie discovered with his cheapest Abarth, the engine can still run on a single quart of oil! Not that I'd want to test that out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aside from this one hiccup, the car has been performing beautifully during this long drive! No CEL, no error codes in any state, no nothing! I'll keep monitoring the oil levels along with the coolant levels in case it's revealed I have a leak somewhere. Up to now, no mysterious puddles or self-lubricating chassis.\n",

      "Text: You may have seen my earlier post regarding my girl's issues last weekend; she's a 2013 Abarth which I purchased with 22k miles plus an extended warranty sold through the dealership with a company in NJ. Regardless, I made it back to Brooklyn from Lower CT with a knocking sound (increasing in frequency with acceleration) coming from the engine. I dropped the car off yesterday and spoke to my guy today. The noise is coming from the engine so he's going to start the claim through the warranty company. He said It's going to cost me $1k for the engine tear down. And that usually, they will need to replace the engine. Something I cannot afford to do and am hopeful the warranty pays. I mean, this is the exact kind of issue they're supposed to cover. They didn't cover the door handle that stopped working after my kid pulled on it. They didn't cover an issue with the clutch.\n",

      "Author: Beneficial-Average22\n",
      "Text: Hello Everyone, I am relatively new to the Abarth community here on reddit and have found a lot of helpful tips and tricks that I will keep in mind on my current project. My car (Fiat 500T 2013 with 130k miles) is being completely rebuilt. I live in Ohio where rust is a major problem and I love my car and I am willing to learn everything I can about cars and specifically 500's. What started this is the cruel treatment dealerships have given me around here. But at the end of the day I am a IT guy to car guy somehow. The current modifications on the car were small things that needed to be changed out and fixed. Such as Sparks, Coils, Diverter Valve, Madness Go Pedal, Removed Cat (sounds awesome) and many many bolts being replaced due to poor treatment from mechanics over the years. Next on the list which I do have all the parts for is MaxFlow Induction Kit, Cover Plate, Valve Springs (with all the gaskets and silicon due to mileage and leaky cylinder1 plug), Custom Exhaust 2.5\" single and Front Mounted Brace. The next thing I can not quite figure out is what truly is the next step to go after these parts. I am aware I still need a Madness Tune (important due to my warranty) but I would like everything that needs to be in place done first. This brings me to my original question for the community, what truly is the best intercooler around that is actively kept in stock and truly had a impact on performance while also being able to stand the test of time. This car will be the end all be all of performance. The end goal of all of these things will be hopefully and dyno of 250 HP or more.\n",
      "\n",
      "If there is anymore questions on the next thing I will be doing after the intercooler it should be changing the coils struts and subframe brace as well as the hats on the struts. After we do that it will be Rims and tires from 16\" to 17\" Madness Rims that I have chosen. Yes the rotors and brakes will be upgraded due to the stopping power I would need at that rate. Meth Injection will be the very last thing due to the risk when I can afford to replace the engine if I have to.\n",

It's Stage 3 tune with Intercooler, DP, exhaust, hybrid Turbo, e wastegate exhaust, etc. Awaiting full buildsheet and dyno results. Says it's getting 240WHP peak if I remember correctly. It's a 2017 with 70k km on the clock and 25-30k on the total build, about 10k on the tune.\n",

      "Edit: updated some of the details after checking with sellers rep. it has stock internals, but the tune is \"only\" 240 on peak. also seller's rep cleared up the story. He's the first owner and used it before Covid to commute. During Covid, he and his mechanic friend started building it, and only upgraded the tune more recently. The exhaust is Akrapovic.\n",

      "Text: Interested in buying an Abarth 500 here in the states. There's a 2013 near me that I was looking into, but I've also been considering finding a cabrio model. I used to have (technically still have but it doesn't work) an Audi S4 cabriolet and with things warming up and with a vacation even coming soon I'm just kinda considering a drop top. I know it's not a true convertible, but a retractable roof is a nice option, not to mention hearing more of that exhaust. \n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, with that you do kinda lose the daily functionality of a hatch. Sure the rear seats still fold but you don't have the big hatch opening. I'm also wondering about the visibility detractments, convertibles often have less visibility than a hard top when the top isn't rolled down. I'm wondering if owners of the cabrio could weigh in on that. There isn't one for sale near me I can look at, so I can't really compare it to the hardtops in person. \n",
      "\n",
      "Was wondering what the opinions were, I suppose. Also I guess if those roofs are any good. Commonly faulty or leaky, easy to maintain if they do break, horrible nightmare part, etc... If I did get one, I don't currently plan to drive in the winter with it, if that makes a difference for functionality.\n",

      "Firstly, cold starts are a pain in the arse the car sounds and acts like its drowning in fuel  its starts then dies and then starts right back up. Its doing this since the 600 km mark. \n",
      "\n",
      "Onto the next problem. When idling at a red light or whatever the engine vibrates weirdly  mostly when its cold  but also sometimes when its warmed up.  Sometimes it even drops to around 500 rpm and theni have to rev it a little cause im scared it will just die on me. \n",
      "Tho it hasnt done that since around 1000 km. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And the last thing is the cluth or the gearbox in general. This isnt my first manual car and ive never had any problems at all but since the 2000 km mark its basically impossible to take off smoothly from stand still. It always vibrates slightly or fells like the cluth is slipping. This also occurs when shifting from 1st-2nd gear. \n",

      "Intermittent start, no start. Battery seemed to be good, but vehicle would not crank, no starter engage, no solenoid click.\n",
      "\n",
      "Resolution:\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I replaced the starter, presuming that the intermittent start was caused by its age. This seemed to temporarily resolve the issue, which reappeared the next month.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, I checked the ground strap from body to transmission. It appeared to be on the verge of failure, so I purchased two battery cables from Autozone - one I ran to replace the original strap from the body to the transmission (which required the removal of the clutch slave cylinder. Reminder: keep some tension on the slave with a zip tie, or it will pop out, and you'll have to bleed the clutch). Still no luck on starting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, I followed the hint of jumping out the clutch switch detailed [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uze9mUXP33c). This was the resolution: the clutch switch relay had failed. I jumped out the relay with a piece of wire just like in the video, and the vehicle starts just fine now. I realize that the video shows an Abarth, but the clutch switch relay is in the same location.\n",

I totally love the car, I have some attachment to it, and it may have just died and I'm really hoping I can find someone on here that may give me something to try before I give up hope and am forced to basically scrap the car.  \n",
      "\n",
      "So, its 5 years old, 59k miles, but been my daily driver for those 5 years, mostly to work, recently my miles have really increased and about 10k of those are in the past 3-4 months alone.   During that time I had something weird happen, all the dash lights lit up and went a bit weird, the car actually shut off for a split second, then turned itself back on, and resumed like nothing happened, all while in motion, that was like a month ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "This issue:  I was driving home yesterday and I go to press the gas, immediately I notice no real response, no boost, and my exhaust note has changed to sound like it has some kinda sputter.  My boost gauge is moving, but can't be right as I have no power.   I pull off, and when the car is idle is really low RPMs, like 700, pressing the gas from this results in a lot of vibration and low power response.    I manage to limp the car home, but something is very wrong.\n",

      "There is no longer a Fiat dealership in my area, the nearest to me is well over an hour away, I pick a local repair shop with a good reputation, but probably little personal knowledge of my engine.  **Error code P301, no compression in cylinder 1.**   I have them check the coil, the vaccum seal, spark plugs, everything, they even remove the entire intake manifold so they can look at the piston itself.  Everything they attempt, including some kinda \"oil test\" with the piston still results a tiny bit of compression which fades into no compression quickly.   They still haven't been able to actually SEE a problem, everything from the eye looks fine, but...no compression.   They are convinced it has to be something in the bottom of the motor, like the crank or that the rings on the piston might have gone blown.  \n",

      "Author: aggressivelyaries416\n",
      "Text: So I've been thinking of upgrading the exhaust on my 500 pop for a while now. I've looked at some but because Fiat isn't that popular in North America there are few products (let alone video reviews of them on YT) out there. I was wondering if I got an exhaust off a 500 Abarth and installed it on mine would it still sound good? I know it won't sound exactly the same but would it make my car sound raspy or just \"off\" I guess? Would doing a muffler delete on my car help with these issues?\n",

Started with a whirring coming from the transmission (throw out bearing dying) and ended with a completely nonfunctional clutch. The cause, at this point, I believe to be a blown input shaft seal, which sprayed the clutch assembly with trans fluid and completely drained the transmission of fluid. Now I must replace the clutch assembly and throw out bearing at a minimum, but I am sure there will be more as I do not yet know the cause of the blown seal.\n",

      "Financially, this will be really difficult for me, I can barely afford the parts, and I absolutely cannot afford to take it to the dealer, I will have to do this 14 hour job myself. Warranty is out of the question. I guess i'm just looking for advice on the best way to go about doing this, and if there are any options I have to save money. I have already purchased the throw out bearing and proper trans fluid. I will also need the technical walkthroughs if anyone has any, if not, I will purchase them.\n",

      "Author: hjungj21o\n",
      "Text: Hi everyone,\n",
      "\n",
      "I picked up a 2013 Fiat 500 Abarth (my first manual tranny car!) two weeks ago.The previous owner had installed a new entertainment unit (Pioneer AVH-4200NEX) in lieu of the stock radio unit, as well as a subwoofer in the trunk.Everything was in great working condition during inspection of the car, and I hadn't felt the need to turn on any music until last night while I was doing some late night cruising on the highway... That's when I realized the driver's side speaker and tweeter would cut in and out. Not sure what triggers the sound coming back in. Upon closer inspection, I found that when the driver's side speakers do come in, the passenger side speakers seem to go out so they are alternating cutting in and out (although the passenger side speakers seem to hold onto the sound a little more). My guess is bad wiring during installation of the subwoofer and head unit + the wet, cold conditions of the Northeast US.\n",
      "\n",
      "The subwoofer is directly behind the driver's side back seat, if that helps. Not the end of the world because I'd rather listen to the exhaust notes when putting around town but it would still bother me during longer drives that I'd have to make from time to time. If you guys had any similar experiences, I'd love to hear about it and what you did to fix the issue before I start contacting dealers/shops around me for a proper diagnosis/quotes for repair. \n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, and for a more serious issue - when I do stall the car (still getting used to the car) and turn back on, the airbag check light comes on for 15 seconds, and then goes away. It does not throw that error when I start the car normally, not quickly after stalling. Is this anything serious that I should look into?\n",

I understand that in the 2018 models, the Pop and Lounge both have turbo now but not at powerful as the Abarth. Would someone be willing to explain the other minute differences in the three models? I dont want to go into the dealer without having an idea and being sold something I dont need. I dont require fancy trimmings or seatings. I dont want a sunroof as I heard that really takes away from headroom. I dont know what the difference between a hatchback and cabrio is. From what I do know, I would think to only decide between a Pop and Abarth unless if the Lounge has something really unique that I mustve missed while comparing the specs on the site.  \n",

I want to get an Abarth but is it really worth it to get an Abarth (additional $100/mo on lease according to website) now over a Pop or Lounge that have a turbo for typical use? Is the Turbo in the Pop and Lounge sufficient to not make the car feel sluggish in those times of merging needs. I dont intend to do crazy speeds. Maximum 70MPH if thats the current traffic flow on the freeway. I probably will only be the only one in the car most of the time aside from the occasional girlfriend and even more rare family. Id have 4 seats full maybe a handful of times a year. I want to get automatic transmission for those long rides out of state and to make things easier for my girlfriend if she decides to drive it now and then. Usual commute is a little less than  25miles/day with a mix of highways and local streets (terrible conditions). Im not a speed demon but at the same time i dont want to ever feel buyers remorse in getting the lesser slower model although Ive read here that the older 2013(?) turbo models had the same power as current 2018 Pop/Lounge. I currently (share) drive a 2016 Honda FIT and want to get a car for my OWN. Any input is appreciate!  \n",

      "Text: So I've been looking around for my first car (and my dream car at that), and I've been torn between ND Miata or the 124 Spider. I've been more towards the Miata because of the many options already available in the used market with GT/Club trims already being listed at sub-$20k USD.\n",
      "\n",
      "The *right* 124 Spider is just harder to find, especially that it has a lot more variations. The more options it has, the more rare it is to find especially here in the US. I actually found one with my dream configuration: Abarth, LED lights (hard to find *with* Abarth trim), white with heritage stripe (which is even *more* rare to find here in US), *zomg red leather seats!!*... automatic. Sure it doesn't have the red front lip or mirror caps like the Euro spec'd Abarths but this comes pretty damn close. Those are easy fixes anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a deal breaker? I'm a patient man and I can wait. If a car had your dream configuration but was an automatic, would you turn away?\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm really struggling with this one and I really don't want to succumb to the automatic. The main reason for choosing the 124 Spider over the Miata was that reviews say it's a better ride, more sound deadening. I live out in the suburbs where it's mostly residential and highways and felt like I would just be torturing myself in the long run if I had the Miata mostly out in the highways vs the 124 Spider which is more of a truer GT cruiser. I'm also out in the Northeast so the top will be up for a good portion of the year.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had this creeping thought in my head that *maybeeee* the automatic wouldn't be too bad? I was watching reviews of the automatic still being able to do burnouts. Ugh, someone please stop me from having these heathen thoughts.\n",

I’ve read quite a few people say they tend to fall apart a little easy, but that most of the typical issues can usually be either fixed or outright avoided with some aftermarket work. Since it’s been a goal of mine to learn the ins and outs of my car anyway, I figured this could, in the long run, become a good learning experience.\n",

I’m not looking to try to get 250+ HP or anything crazy out of it; just looking for wrench time and part swaps that could be put in that would improve reliability, fuel economy, etc... You know, the useful daily stuff. I drive it hard on city streets, but don’t tend to speed by much, and I don’t usually break 90 on a freeway unless it’s just totally empty. So what would be some things to look at, or at least plan on dealing with eventually? Any relevant work you guys have done that you were satisfied with the results of?\n",

      "I found a set of what I’m looking for on BrakePerformance for like $250. Reviews seem to be positive on the individual set as well as the site as a whole. This is a bit cheaper than I’ve seen on more specialty sites like 500madness which are around $500 and up to $800 for pads and rotors. Seeing as the reviews are good for both products, should I have any issues going for the $250 set? I should mention that all the information I found on drilled and slotted rotors like chamfering the holes is done on the cheaper option as well and a lifetime warranty for warping and cracking, I can’t see an immediate reason why they’re so much cheaper. \n",
      "On the installation front, what should I be looking at? I have no idea on what labor should cost, but the Big O that has been the nicest to me and my car said they’ll install brakes I buy myself because they don’t carry any drilled etc for the 500 Abarth I drive. How much should that cost? If anyone has any shop recommendations etc as well let me know.\n",

They are worried that, since I live in Michigan, it won't be able to hold up to the snow. Size wise, they're worries that semis will not be able to see me, even though when I drive I ensure that truck drivers know if my presence (keeping visual contact with the trucks rear views, using turn signals (like you should) and passing at safe distances).

      "Text: Hi!\n",
      "I bought a 500 Abarth about 6 months ago and have put about 8k Miles on it while living in the city (come on it just begs to be driven) and was recently in the shop replacing a headlight (I know I know I should do myself and save some money) and one of the techs saw my suspension and said wow I have that in my car it’s amazing and said that it’s a 3k coilover situation. I knew it had modded suspension and was lowered but I never asked what it was besides what brand and was it reliable. \n",
      "The obvious answer is that it is Bilstein B16s available on 500 madness (https://shop.500madness.com/fiat-500-abarth-cid114/suspension-and-brakes-cid121/suspension-upgrades-cid267/fiat-500-coilover-kit-by-bilstein-b16-pss10-adjustable-north-american-model-pid3413) but I noticed the B14s for a third of the price.

And perhaps more importantly, what is the actual difference between the two? A quick search shows that the 16s are adjustable (being coilovers I assume that means adjusting the coil height with a wrench etc.) why can’t that be done with the 14s though? \n",
      "I’m a noob in this world, and would love an actual explanation and not just criticism for either spending 3k on something that is the same as a 1k solution even though I wasn’t the one spending it or buying a car without knowing what modded suspension it has. Oh and if you couldn’t tell from the links Im in the US and my car is a 2014. Thanks\n",

      "\n",
      "First off, I drive on average about an hour, twice a day, 4 times a week (about 80km a day) so I will be clocking a fair bit of mileage. I also need the car to last me at minimum 4 years because I'm buying a condo in a few months won't be able to afford a new car any time soon. This limits my budget to about $12,000 CAD which isn't a lot, but there are a few options available for me. \n",
      "\n",
      "For the turbo's I'm a bit spoiled for choice as the average mileage is between 40-60,000km (25-37,000 miles) for ones in my price range, but for the Abarth, only 2012-2013's are available, and all the options I have are over 100,000km (62000 miles)! For obvious reasons I would prefer an Abarth, but will settle for the turbo if necessary. I'm just concerned with reliability. My GF has had a 500 now for 4 years and it has been relatively problem free, but she only drives in town and its never more than 5 or 6 minutes on the road. Not sure how well these vehicles would hold up to the amount of driving I do, especially with higher mileage models. \n",

Many of these models at which I'm closely looking are starting to get up there in miles (55,000+), so I'm wondering how much it would cost if, worst case, I have to do some serious repairs on the car I purchase. I'll happily do any work myself that I can, so part prices would be appreciated as well.\n",

Not that I want to do that in either car. I live in Montana and speed limits are not enforced and some roads are twisty if you look for them. Great place to own a fast car!\n",

      "Author: jkbenn02\n",
      "Text: TLDR: FCA part number 68228884AD uses the same brackets as Abarths. \n",
      "\n",
      "Warning…I’m used to long forum posts so forgive the rambling. Also another warning, the fogs aren’t installed yet. \n",
      "\n",
      "After successfully installing NHK Gen V bi-led headlight projector assemblies in my 2013 Abarth I wanted to complete the lighting package with proper LED fog lights. I had tried just bulbs (in the headlights) but I knew it wouldn’t provide good lighting and while also knowing that it would likely make me a menace to society riding around with light going everywhere.  At least I could confirm personally that they sucked. And they did.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I say proper because far too many people are just swapping bulbs which just isn’t right. Shitty beam patterns…regardless of how much they claim that “my $50 led bulbs are great”. 🙄trust me..they aren’t great. They may be brighter than halogens but the pattern is horrible even if you clock the bulbs in every direction. \n",
      "\n",
      "Anyways, I split the headlights via baking and installed the LED projectors in place of the original halogens using various adapters. It was a lot of work and well worth the effort. Now the  headlights are just amazing and on par with my Tesla 3 which are extremely good. I used aftermarket Depo headlights as I didn’t want to deal with the OE permaseal. It was still a painful process (hot headlights are no fun to open). At least this way I could take my time as the car still had the headlights in place. \n",
      "\n",
      "On to the main topic, the fog lights:\n",
      "\n",
      "SURELY I’m not the first person to notice this but I haven’t seen anyone else post this before. These cars have been out for over a decade and the community is pretty damn good especially when it comes to modding them. \n",
      "\n",
      "Anyways, I wanted to share this with you all. Despite all those out there claiming no replacements exist I believe I can prove otherwise. \n",
      "\n",
      "I think we can all agree that the Abarth fog assemblies have a distinctive look to them when removed. So off to eBay I went. A quick cross reference of the oe part number showed a number of the other FCA cars that used the same assembly. This gave me hope 🤣\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I backed out that part number from my search and just put “LED Fog dodge” (or other brand such as Jeep) and you will quickly see factory LED fog lights that look almost identical to the Abarth fog lights. I could have stopped there and thrown those into my bumper but I wanted something better.  So if you want LED bolt in fog lights just stop here. For around ~$60 you can’t beat them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I bought a cheap set of LED fog lights on eBay (part number 68228884AD) to compare to the Abarth’s fogs. I couldn’t tell a difference between the Abarth and Jeep brackets so I took the next step of getting Morimoto XB fog lights (part number LF620). These are marketed for all those other FCA models previously mentioned but no 500 Abarth at all but it only took me a few small leaps to make the “connection”)\n",
      "\n",
      "If going the aftermarket OE route, just install them as delivered. I can’t comment on the wiring for those but the plug looks the same between the OE abarth H11 plug and the aftermarket OE style led. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’ll be installing the Morimotos soon so I’ll update this if there are any issues. Even if some type of resistor is needed that is still not a big deal. \n",
      "\n",
      "NOTE: The reflector on the aftermarket OE style are going to be about 3/8” shorter compared to the original fog lights BUT the chrome trim rings appear to be the same depth so there shouldn’t be a larger gap or anything like that. \n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps I’m missing something mounting-wise and nobody is talking about it but I think this is a good solution for inexpensively upgrading your fogs to LEDs for about the same price as doing it the wrong way (just installing led bulbs into your halogen housings)\n",
      "\n",

Replacing those broken parts required removing the transmission and replacing the oil pan as well. After we got it all back together, it wouldn't start, then bad weather hit and it had to sit for a while. This weekend, after enough cranking to re-prime the fuel pump, it started! Aaaand, proceeded to dump most of the transmission fluid on the ground due to a bad seal on the transmission cooler. Replaced that, refilled the transmission (it's a PITA on the Automatics) and was able to drive it around the neighborhood without incident! Still need to put the front bumper back on and then get it inspected, but we're closer than we've been in a while!\n",

      "Text: I have been looking at a 500 Abarth in Indianapolis. The problem is I live in St Louis. I know it's a long shot, but I was wondering if there was anyone here near Indy (Garfield Park more specifically), that would be willing to go check it out and let me know if they think is even worth pursuing. Not looking for a ppi or any guarantee, just an educated eye that could let me know if it's decent, and maybe get a feel for the dealer, they don't have the most glowing reviews. Of you think you could help send me a pm and we can discuss things, including compensation. Thanks.\n",

I put 37 psi in there yesterday and it will probably be 34 today and 29 by Wednesday. Regardless. I'm used to cars with regular power steering and no power assist. So I'm used to it pulling some and having to compensate myself. With the electric. I know the tire is low. I'm not really compensating for it. It feels like someone else is doing it.\n",

      "Author: APB3\n",
      "Text: I asked: \n",
      "\n",
      "I have a turbocharged car. Many companies sell insulating \"blankets\" for the turbocharger such that the heat on the hot side of the turbo becomes hotter and the intake charge on the cold side of the turbo becomes colder. As a result, power is increased. I'm not doubting that this is true, but I have a concern: by forcing the turbo to become hotter isn't it at risk of premature failure? The companies that make these blankets deny this, but I still worry.\n",
      "\n",
      "It replied:\n",
      "\n",
      "The use of insulating blankets on turbochargers can increase power output by reducing the amount of heat lost from the exhaust gases as they pass through the turbocharger. This reduces the amount of heat that is absorbed by the engine bay and the surrounding components, which can help to lower intake air temperatures and increase engine efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, you are right to be concerned about the potential impact of increased temperatures on the turbocharger itself. Turbochargers are designed to operate within specific temperature ranges, and excessive heat can cause premature wear and failure of the turbocharger.\n",
      "\n",
      "The manufacturers of these insulating blankets may deny any negative impact on the turbocharger, but it is important to understand that any modification to the turbocharger, including the use of insulating blankets, can affect its performance and longevity. The risk of premature failure may depend on factors such as the quality of the blanket, the operating conditions of the turbocharger, and the maintenance and care of the engine and turbocharger.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you are considering using an insulating blanket on your turbocharger, it is important to do your research and choose a high-quality product that is designed specifically for your turbocharger model. You should also consult with a trusted mechanic or tuner who has experience with turbocharged engines to evaluate the potential risks and benefits of using such a product.\n",

      "Author: dZisky\n",
      "Text: Hello all! My cat got lucky today because my gf Abarth (2011 European 595C) didn't start when we wanted to go for the vet appointment. When I turned the key, I heard rapid clicking sound (sounded like relay), but nothing was happening, the alternator didn't even try to start the engine. On the next try, I also saw errors on the screen \"check gearbox\" (it is automatic) and \"power steering error\". On the next try, the screen also got very dark couldn't almost read anything from it, so it looked like a dead battery. I popped up the hood, checked the battery clamps, and a positive one was a bit loose (not totally loose, but I could twist it with my hands). So I thought that was the problem, went home, got some tools and a multimeter. Tightened the clamp and checked the voltage on the battery it was showing 12.00V, so not a dead battery as I initially thought, but after tightening the clamp still the same issue - won't start, throws lots of errors. So I also disconnected and reconnected ECU connectors and checked the error codes with the ODB scanner. It showed a lot of errors, but they all seem quite random, can't see any root cause there (full list [here](https://gist.github.com/DavidZisky/6b1f5c4760c34a3d0fe1c8c668f29b47)). So it looks like some weird \"everything is wrong\" electrical error. I know how to fix cars and what to check next, but I'm new to Abarth, so I'm asking here if there is any common/well-known issue that would cause such symptoms?\n",

      "Author: IHeartOurContinent\n",
      "Text: Hello, I'm an owner of a Spider Abarth 124. Bought it three years ago. I now wonder if I just need to dump the car. It's my first ever car, I'm an NYC local and got my license about three months before I got the car. Cars are still an alien concept to me, particularly the mechanics. It's a great car to learn how to better drive with, but I hit a curb and now the alignment is off. I've been stuck in mechanic hell for the last week. I have a new job in FL and I'm in Los Angeles now. I have to get it shipped out by Wed. I keep having to order new parts. First the rims. That showed up. Shop owner at Pepboys said he had my tire. He didn't. They ordered, guarantee a day for tire to show. Three days later, no tire. So i towed it to another mechanic. It's Friday. He won't look at it til Monday. I need new suspension I was told. So if he looks at it Monday, will he tell me I need all these weird parts for the suspension that no other mechanic has and I have to order? Or is there a reasonable expectation this can be fixed in a day? I am buying a run flat that works tomorrow. I am hoping Monday morning, he has tires, rims, and can have my car ready Tuesday night. I don't need a ton of fixes. I really need the tire and rim on there so it can be in decent enough shape to be shipped.\n",
      "But is even that unrealistic? And how much is suspension fix? I set aside 5k for the whole fix. I don't speak car language, I'm so ovweherlmed and while I tried getting help last Monday, I've faced a series of delays of not having parts, parts promised they'd ship quickly, they don't, and my car just sits there. Do I just toss the damn thing? Guy at shop offered me 1,500. Seems low. It's been all around the continent and handled tough terrain. It has 80k miles on it and has been to 15 states in Mexico, 20 in the US and four provinces in Canada. I've taken it through many long 6 minth road trips across North America. Wondering if it's time to say goodbye, or if you guys could help, tell me what questions to ask and how to be aggressive enough to get car fixed in a timely manner. Thanks\n",

The next time I started it (to go get the code scanned) the idling was smooth but the CEL was still there. The code it was throwing was a faulty/dirty MAP sensor. So I replaced that, and for a car that has only 18k miles, that MAP sensor was filthy. Yesterday, I started the car up and had another CEL and it was idling rough like the last time but this time I took it straight to a store and had it scanned. This time I got one code with no definition and another saying cylinder #4 was misfiring. I started the car back up after scanning, and it was idling smooth and sounded fine.  \n",
      "The conclusion me and a buddy have come to is I need to replace the coils and spark plugs. Also, maybe this is why the MAP sensor was so dirty, because it just wasn't burning hot enough? What do you guys think? Also what brand would you recommend for coils and plugs?\n",

When idling the car sputters just a bit. It isn't a drastic sputter, but definitely enough to notice. I was able to drive the car back home. It actually drive just fine, accelerates fine, and drives normally at speed but the boost is worrying me. I'm making a lot more boost relative to rpm than is normal. When cruising at 55mph before this CEL, you guys know that the boost gauge should be practically sitting at the bottom of the gauge. But now it's at about 4-6psi at about 2-2.5k rpm. It's very odd. This is my first ever turbocharged car, so I really don't know what could have gone wrong to throw this CEL and cause these symptoms. I'm going to have it scanned at an autozone today but I wanted to get some opinions from some other Abarth owners as well.  \n",

      "* Driving home on one hour drive via highway.\n",
      "* Two miles before home, dash \"battery charging system light\" (battery icon) goes on/off approx. every 15 seconds\n",

      "* 1/2 mile before home both lights remain solid and not randomly blinking on/off.\n",
      "* Pull into local garage which is open. Engine begins sputtering a bit.\n",
      "* Negative cable on battery was a bit loose (I had switched battery myself 6 months ago). Mechanic tightens negative battery cable to battery. Car turns off (I believe we turned off engine and it didn't stall)\n",
      "* Car will NOT turn back on. Car has power but engine is not cranking.\n",
      "* EDIT (added): Battery is checked and is outputting proper voltage.\n",
      "* Mechanic checks for codes which supposedly resets the computer system in the process. I recall him saying multiple codes were showing up and to leave the car. Tech believes it's the starter since the engine won't crank.\n",
      "* Mechanic calls - says the starter needs to be replaced. Cost $600 USD w/ labor.\n",
      "* Mechanic calls - starter replaced and apparently needed replacement, however it did not fix the issue.\n",
      "* They are now getting a code pointing to the alternator so they are testing the alternator for improper voltage.\n",
      "* Mechanic believes it could be the alternator but hoping it's not the ECU.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Notes:** Car has a 500 Madness ECM piggyback as well as a GoPedal.\n",
      "\n",
      "My questions for the experts here is does the diagnosis so far seem correct? I really don't want to go bankrupt trying to get my beauty fixed if I should be going to a different mechanic who specializes in Fiat. I'm concerned they will repair the alternator and then tell me it didn't fix the issue and loop will continue. The closest Fiat dealer from me is 20 miles away and I would need to have it towed there since the car won't start.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, I am 8 miles west of Boston. If anyone is in this area and swears by their mechanic, I could use any recommendations for either this or future repairs. Thank you for reading and any assistance.\n",
      "\n",
      "**UPDATE 1/20/23:** Mechanic called and new starter was broken. Tried another one - also broken. Tested both starters outside of the car and they work. Tested my original starter outside of the car and **IT WORKED**. Put starter back in my car and would not turn on. Apparently, there is a tricky way regarding the wiring to power the starter which was not set correctly. Once this was figured out after several phone calls from my mechanics to others, the car turned on without issues! He replaced the negative terminal to the battery as apparently it was having trouble staying tight.\n",
      "\n",
      "With that said, we will do not know why the car would not turn back on when I originally brought the Abarth to the mechanic with the two dash lights on. I do believe those two lights originally went on from a loose negative terminal to the battery. However, after tightening the negative terminal and clearing out the ECU's codes, the car should have cranked the starter and turned on but it did not. My only guess is there was some sort of safety initiated that prevented the clutch sensor or ignition sensor from allowing the starter to crank? I'll be keeping an eye on it over the next week to see if anything odd occurs but crossing my fingers.\n",

If my understanding is right, could it be possible to swap out the 6 speed from the day the dodge dart into the abarth? Would like to have that extra gearing. If not what transmission would work better than the standard in a ‘13. Figures since the clutch is being finicky going into reverse now that I might want options when it goes fully\n",

I have found and fixed a few things already but this week I have started to notice a burning plastic smell.  Definitely plastic and NOT rubber or oil.  I can only think that it's clutch or brake related but I haven't been able to narrow it down to either just yet.  I don't smell it on a drive until I come to a stop but both clutch and brakes are being used at that time.  Other than those, I also had the heated seats on and would notice the seats were getting warmer when the smell would come up.  If it were the seats, I would imagine I'd smell it while cruising, but only happens at start/stop at an intersection.  \n",

My car is modded and tuned and normally hits 25lbs from 2nd onwards. When it holds 18psi it’s constant and fine, no issues, and same when it hits 25lbs in 4th. So I’ve determined it can’t be a boost leak, and if my actuator wasn’t set properly it would only hold the same amount of boost through all the gears correct? And if my actuator was faulty it would be overboosting quickly. I recently replaced all the turbo vacuum lines with red silicone ones and zip tied the connections, which I do plan to replace with spring clips, but even so, if those were leaking that doesn’t explain the 18lbs in 1,2,3 and then holding 24 in 4,5 gear.

Scouring the internet, the closest resemblance I can see with body kit option, is in the 2021 euro catalogue where they had a bodykit based on the Anniversario 70th edition (same as the Biposto I believe, with the flared wheel arches). Is this a correct assumption?\n",

      "Text: So my dad and I have the turbo stupid idea of building an engine for my abarth. The engine in it is fairly ok still, it just has signs of poor maintenance history from the previous owner that are showing up. The reason we'd be building it is to get more power and because we're either going to rebuild this one or build a new one. Preference on building a new one so the car is still drivable at all times until the swap is done. If I do that I'd probably plop the bigger turbo, FMIC and put the works in the engine. I am not precisely sure what that entails, but something in the vein of better pistons, cam, block, bottom and top end if possible. So I was wondering how expensive people think that'd be because my guess would be somewhere close to 10k especially if I do better block. Apologies in advance since this isn't the most thorough idea or concise.\n",

      "Text: Hi All, this is going to be a bit of a rant but I hope it gets enough traction to better this community as a whole. As some of you may know we launched Euro2ner.com as a parts seller that caters to this community among other Italian cars. I've come to find that the majority of vendors don't list part numbers or outright Photoshop them off the items. This is to protect their pricing scheme but at the end of the day it makes it so much harder to find replacement parts that came as a set or takes away the ability to cross shop and consider alternatives. We see this on any number of items, the most offensive being the \"big injectors\" being sold for the US Abarth. These are Bosch PN 0280158117.... Go ahead and try to find that info on any vendor page listing the big injectors for sale... Insult to injury is if you had one fail on you, you're out of luck trying to find an individual replacement without reaching out to a vendor who may or may not want to sell you an individual part. On all listings on our site, we're going to include OEM Part numbers so you can find these for yourself if need be. Thank you\n",

Both say they fit my car, but in small text, they show they work with different transmissions. I have the C510 I believe, which wouldn’t be a problem, except that the flywheel almost 3x in price. My question is can I get the one for the C514 transmission or do I just have to bite the bullet on this?\n",

      "Author: None\n",
      "Text: Has anyone had any luck importing an Abarth 595 to the states?  Or even know who to contact about it?  I had an Abarth 500 that I loved and sold on 2017 never imagining I wouldn’t be able to get another one.  (We had taken in a relatives newborn and his car seat wouldn’t fit in the backseat).  Now we can’t buy them here, in fact the US seems to be getting rid of all their hot hatches. I got brand new VW Golf in 2021 but it’s no where near as fun as the Abarth was.  I hit a deer with it and I’ve been a rental for almost a year now.  Buying another new VW GTI or R is proving to be very difficult they don’t have them anywhere and I’d rather have the Abarth anyway\n",

I took it back to the garage who took them all off and checked them all and re fitted them and they are doing it worse than ever! Any advice to stop it?\n",

I have a single lane driveway and didn't feel like playing musical cars for a few weeks, so it sat. But now when I try to start it, it just cranks and cranks. I can hear sound from the exhaust, so the motor is definitely spinning: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uba-PtlEiC8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uba-PtlEiC8)\n",

It's there right now and I didn't snap any pictures of the side skirts before dropping it. But they are coming off the car, I think because of how rough the dude was about loading it onto the trailer and unloading it. I'm not too happy about that, but it should be an easy enough fix. My question is, what's the best tape/glue/ whatever to use to stick em back onto the body? I would imagine it's a pretty straight forward fix, but will there be any need for anything like a heat gun or any other tools? Thanks!\n",

      "\n",
      "I discovered during my regular checks during a fill-up that the dipstick was dry. It's always been very difficult to get an accurate reading because the Euro Platinum is too clear and clean in my car. I got around this problem by rolling the dipstick on a clean shop wipe and matching the stain with the dipstick.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also believe the oil left inside the dipstick tube stil manages to coat the dipstick when pulled out the second time, giving me a false reading that the engine is topped off. I suspect my car has always burned a bit of oil, but the dipstick always had a coating of oil because of the oil left in the dipstick tube screwing things up.\n",
      "\n",
      "I found a way to read the oil accurately with only one extra step. The first and third steps are the same (pull out, wipe clean, reinsert, pull out, read), but the second step involves reinserting the dipstick until it hesitates. Instead of pushing the dipstick all the way in, you pull it out and wipe again. That cleaned out any oil left in the dipstick tube, and no extra oil was dragged into the dipstick tube.\n",
      "\n",
      "After I added a quart of oil a bit at a time and tried my technique to confirm the oil level was coming up, applying the dipstick on a shop wipe revealed the oil level was back to the top of the mark, and no oil was present on the skinny part of the dipstick after the top mark.\n",
      "\n",
      "Worst case scenario is my car ran on 3 quarts of oil for a while. But as Tyler Hoovie discovered with his cheapest Abarth, the engine can still run on a single quart of oil! Not that I'd want to test that out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aside from this one hiccup, the car has been performing beautifully during this long drive! No CEL, no error codes in any state, no nothing!

It cranks and the starter and fuel pump seem fine, but we can’t get it to turn over, i ran a code scanner through but I didn’t get any codes, I know this is a very broad question and doesn’t just apply to this car, but I was wondering if there’s anything in particular with the model that I should look out for that isn’t a universal tip. Just looking for anything easy to check before I send it somewhere and spend more money than necessary. Anything would help.\n",

I'm putting money on them not working, as the gap between 6.5 and 7.6 is big enough. I doubt I can get a wider tire and have it fit on there. Any advice is appreciated!

However, the oil pressure light didn't turn on (even though it's working on start up), and I drove a bunch of km in the meantime and never has any light come on. Also when I finish driving there is some oil on the stick always. Should I worry?\n",

Regardless, I made it back to Brooklyn from Lower CT with a knocking sound (increasing in frequency with acceleration) coming from the engine. I dropped the car off yesterday and spoke to my guy today. The noise is coming from the engine so he's going to start the claim through the warranty company. He said It's going to cost me $1k for the engine tear down. And that usually, they will need to replace the engine. Something I cannot afford to do and am hopeful the warranty pays. I mean, this is the exact kind of issue they're supposed to cover. They didn't cover the door handle that stopped working after my kid pulled on it. They didn't cover an issue with the clutch.\n",

      "Anyway, I'm just venting here. If anyone has any anecdotes or personal experience with this strange issue, please share. My baby girl (I named her Anna Lucia) who I adore is way too young to be having such problems.\n",

      "Author: Beneficial-Average22\n",
      "Text: Hello Everyone, I am relatively new to the Abarth community here on reddit and have found a lot of helpful tips and tricks that I will keep in mind on my current project. My car (Fiat 500T 2013 with 130k miles) is being completely rebuilt. I live in Ohio where rust is a major problem and I love my car and I am willing to learn everything I can about cars and specifically 500's. What started this is the cruel treatment dealerships have given me around here. But at the end of the day I am a IT guy to car guy somehow. The current modifications on the car were small things that needed to be changed out and fixed. Such as Sparks, Coils, Diverter Valve, Madness Go Pedal, Removed Cat (sounds awesome) and many many bolts being replaced due to poor treatment from mechanics over the years. Next on the list which I do have all the parts for is MaxFlow Induction Kit, Cover Plate, Valve Springs (with all the gaskets and silicon due to mileage and leaky cylinder1 plug), Custom Exhaust 2.5\" single and Front Mounted Brace. The next thing I can not quite figure out is what truly is the next step to go after these parts. I am aware I still need a Madness Tune (important due to my warranty) but I would like everything that needs to be in place done first. This brings me to my original question for the community, what truly is the best intercooler around that is actively kept in stock and truly had a impact on performance while also being able to stand the test of time. This car will be the end all be all of performance. The end goal of all of these things will be hopefully and dyno of 250 HP or more.\n",
      "\n",
      "If there is anymore questions on the next thing I will be doing after the intercooler it should be changing the coils struts and subframe brace as well as the hats on the struts. After we do that it will be Rims and tires from 16\" to 17\" Madness Rims that I have chosen. Yes the rotors and brakes will be upgraded due to the stopping power I would need at that rate. Meth Injection will be the very last thing due to the risk when I can afford to replace the engine if I have to.\n",

I had it set to 12 ft lbs but somehow I snapped the plug in half. Anyone have any luck removing something like this at home or should I call a local mechanic? I have a decent set of tools and can buy stuff if necessary but want to know if this is something someone a little average can work out without any further damage to my engine. Thanks in advance for any help or tips!\n",

      "Text: Interested in buying an Abarth 500 here in the states. There's a 2013 near me that I was looking into, but I've also been considering finding a cabrio model. I used to have (technically still have but it doesn't work) an Audi S4 cabriolet and with things warming up and with a vacation even coming soon I'm just kinda considering a drop top. I know it's not a true convertible, but a retractable roof is a nice option, not to mention hearing more of that exhaust. \n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, with that you do kinda lose the daily functionality of a hatch. Sure the rear seats still fold but you don't have the big hatch opening. I'm also wondering about the visibility detractments, convertibles often have less visibility than a hard top when the top isn't rolled down. I'm wondering if owners of the cabrio could weigh in on that. There isn't one for sale near me I can look at, so I can't really compare it to the hardtops in person. \n",
      "\n",
      "Was wondering what the opinions were, I suppose. Also I guess if those roofs are any good. Commonly faulty or leaky, easy to maintain if they do break, horrible nightmare part, etc... If I did get one, I don't currently plan to drive in the winter with it, if that makes a difference for functionality.\n",

It always vibrates slightly or fells like the cluth is slipping. This also occurs when shifting from 1st-2nd gear. \n",

Really didn't want to pay almost $20 for it with shipping just to see if it'd be as fun & ridiculous as I thought in person. \n",
      "\n",
      "Slightly resized the decal from seller's selection, added the Abarth side door stripe graphic to personalize it, printed, laminated & cut it myself then used a little outdoor adhesive tape to adhere it to the inside of the hatch. Messed with placement spots before landing on where it is, then stuck the double sided mounting tape on.  Might order a professionally done replacement when this wears out, but for now I'm pretty happy.\n",

      "Author: jkbenn02\n",
      "Text: TLDR: FCA part number 68228884AD uses the same brackets as Abarths. \n",
      "\n",
      "Warning…I’m used to long forum posts so forgive the rambling. Also another warning, the fogs aren’t installed yet. \n",
      "\n",
      "After successfully installing NHK Gen V bi-led headlight projector assemblies in my 2013 Abarth I wanted to complete the lighting package with proper LED fog lights. I had tried just bulbs (in the headlights) but I knew it wouldn’t provide good lighting and while also knowing that it would likely make me a menace to society riding around with light going everywhere.  At least I could confirm personally that they sucked. And they did.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I say proper because far too many people are just swapping bulbs which just isn’t right. Shitty beam patterns…regardless of how much they claim that “my $50 led bulbs are great”. 🙄trust me..they aren’t great. They may be brighter than halogens but the pattern is horrible even if you clock the bulbs in every direction. \n",
      "\n",
      "Anyways, I split the headlights via baking and installed the LED projectors in place of the original halogens using various adapters. It was a lot of work and well worth the effort. Now the  headlights are just amazing and on par with my Tesla 3 which are extremely good. I used aftermarket Depo headlights as I didn’t want to deal with the OE permaseal. It was still a painful process (hot headlights are no fun to open). At least this way I could take my time as the car still had the headlights in place. \n",
      "\n",
      "On to the main topic, the fog lights:\n",
      "\n",
      "SURELY I’m not the first person to notice this but I haven’t seen anyone else post this before. These cars have been out for over a decade and the community is pretty damn good especially when it comes to modding them. \n",
      "\n",
      "Anyways, I wanted to share this with you all. Despite all those out there claiming no replacements exist I believe I can prove otherwise. \n",
      "\n",
      "I think we can all agree that the Abarth fog assemblies have a distinctive look to them when removed. So off to eBay I went. A quick cross reference of the oe part number showed a number of the other FCA cars that used the same assembly. This gave me hope 🤣\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I backed out that part number from my search and just put “LED Fog dodge” (or other brand such as Jeep) and you will quickly see factory LED fog lights that look almost identical to the Abarth fog lights. I could have stopped there and thrown those into my bumper but I wanted something better.  So if you want LED bolt in fog lights just stop here. For around ~$60 you can’t beat them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I bought a cheap set of LED fog lights on eBay (part number 68228884AD) to compare to the Abarth’s fogs. I couldn’t tell a difference between the Abarth and Jeep brackets so I took the next step of getting Morimoto XB fog lights (part number LF620). These are marketed for all those other FCA models previously mentioned but no 500 Abarth at all but it only took me a few small leaps to make the “connection”)\n",
      "\n",
      "If going the aftermarket OE route, just install them as delivered. I can’t comment on the wiring for those but the plug looks the same between the OE abarth H11 plug and the aftermarket OE style led. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’ll be installing the Morimotos soon so I’ll update this if there are any issues. Even if some type of resistor is needed that is still not a big deal. \n",
      "\n",
      "NOTE: The reflector on the aftermarket OE style are going to be about 3/8” shorter compared to the original fog lights BUT the chrome trim rings appear to be the same depth so there shouldn’t be a larger gap or anything like that. \n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps I’m missing something mounting-wise and nobody is talking about it but I think this is a good solution for inexpensively upgrading your fogs to LEDs for about the same price as doing it the wrong way (just installing led bulbs into your halogen housings)\n",
      "\n",

      "Text: A couple weeks ago, I noticed that my 2013 Abarth (manual transmission), would have some sort of loud droning noise that spikes up in volume at intervals. I can hear it slightly at 35 miles per hour, then it would be twice as loud at 55 MPH, and it would sound up again at 75 MPH but isn't as loud as 55. So I assumed I had uneven wear on my rear tires since I heard it closer to the rear.\n",

      "I went to a shop to have my tires rotated and rebalanced, and I still hear this droning towards the rear. I even noticed that as I accelerate from 50 to 60, the sound \"rolls\" from underneath the seat to the rear.\n",
      "\n",
      "This droning noise even happens while I'm out of gear and the engine is at 1000RPM in highway speed and I don't hear sputtering/popping at all, so I don't think this is an exhaust leak.\n",

Replacing those broken parts required removing the transmission and replacing the oil pan as well. After we got it all back together, it wouldn't start, then bad weather hit and it had to sit for a while. This weekend, after enough cranking to re-prime the fuel pump, it started! Aaaand, proceeded to dump most of the transmission fluid on the ground due to a bad seal on the transmission cooler. Replaced that, refilled the transmission (it's a PITA on the Automatics) and was able to drive it around the neighborhood without incident! Still need to put the front bumper back on and then get it inspected, but we're closer than we've been in a while!\n",

As a big fan of LEGO when I was a kid, and even now... this decal made me want to break my \"no decals clean look\" on the \\'17 Abarth. Really didn\\'t want to pay almost $20 for it with shipping just to see if it\\'d be as fun &amp; ridiculous as I thought in person. \\n\\nSlightly resized the decal from seller\\'s selection, added the Abarth side door stripe graphic to personalize it, printed, laminated &amp; cut it myself then used a little outdoor adhesive tape to adhere it to the inside of the hatch. Messed with placement spots before landing on where it is, then stuck the double sided mounting tape on.  Might order a professionally done replacement when this wears out, but for now I\\'m pretty happy.',\n",

As a big fan of LEGO when I was a kid, and even now... this decal made me want to break my &amp;quot;no decals clean look&amp;quot; on the &amp;#39;17 Abarth. Really didn&amp;#39;t want to pay almost $20 for it with shipping just to see if it&amp;#39;d be as fun &amp;amp; ridiculous as I thought in person. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Slightly resized the decal from seller&amp;#39;s selection, added the Abarth side door stripe graphic to personalize it, printed, laminated &amp;amp; cut it myself then used a little outdoor adhesive tape to adhere it to the inside of the hatch. Messed with placement spots before landing on where it is, then stuck the double sided mounting tape on.  Might order a professionally done replacement when this wears out, but for now I&amp;#39;m pretty happy.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'TLDR: FCA part number 68228884AD uses the same brackets as Abarths. \\n\\nWarning…I’m used to long forum posts so forgive the rambling. Also another warning, the fogs aren’t installed yet. \\n\\nAfter successfully installing NHK Gen V bi-led headlight projector assemblies in my 2013 Abarth I wanted to complete the lighting package with proper LED fog lights. I had tried just bulbs (in the headlights) but I knew it wouldn’t provide good lighting and while also knowing that it would likely make me a menace to society riding around with light going everywhere.  At least I could confirm personally that they sucked. And they did.  \\n\\nI say proper because far too many people are just swapping bulbs which just isn’t right. Shitty beam patterns…regardless of how much they claim that “my $50 led bulbs are great”. 🙄trust me..they aren’t great. They may be brighter than halogens but the pattern is horrible even if you clock the bulbs in every direction. \\n\\nAnyways, I split the headlights via baking and installed the LED projectors in place of the original halogens using various adapters. It was a lot of work and well worth the effort. Now the  headlights are just amazing and on par with my Tesla 3 which are extremely good. I used aftermarket Depo headlights as I didn’t want to deal with the OE permaseal. It was still a painful process (hot headlights are no fun to open). At least this way I could take my time as the car still had the headlights in place. \\n\\nOn to the main topic, the fog lights:\\n\\nSURELY I’m not the first person to notice this but I haven’t seen anyone else post this before. These cars have been out for over a decade and the community is pretty damn good especially when it comes to modding them. \\n\\nAnyways, I wanted to share this with you all. Despite all those out there claiming no replacements exist I believe I can prove otherwise. \\n\\nI think we can all agree that the Abarth fog assemblies have a distinctive look to them when removed. So off to eBay I went. A quick cross reference of the oe part number showed a number of the other FCA cars that used the same assembly. This gave me hope 🤣\\n\\nThen I backed out that part number from my search and just put “LED Fog dodge” (or other brand such as Jeep) and you will quickly see factory LED fog lights that look almost identical to the Abarth fog lights. I could have stopped there and thrown those into my bumper but I wanted something better.  So if you want LED bolt in fog lights just stop here. For around ~$60 you can’t beat them.\\n\\nI bought a cheap set of LED fog lights on eBay (part number 68228884AD) to compare to the Abarth’s fogs. I couldn’t tell a difference between the Abarth and Jeep brackets so I took the next step of getting Morimoto XB fog lights (part number LF620). These are marketed for all those other FCA models previously mentioned but no 500 Abarth at all but it only took me a few small leaps to make the “connection”)\\n\\nIf going the aftermarket OE route, just install them as delivered. I can’t comment on the wiring for those but the plug looks the same between the OE abarth H11 plug and the aftermarket OE style led. \\n\\nI’ll be installing the Morimotos soon so I’ll update this if there are any issues. Even if some type of resistor is needed that is still not a big deal. \\n\\nNOTE: The reflector on the aftermarket OE style are going to be about 3/8” shorter compared to the original fog lights BUT the chrome trim rings appear to be the same depth so there shouldn’t be a larger gap or anything like that. \\n\\nPerhaps I’m missing something mounting-wise and nobody is talking about it but I think this is a good solution for inexpensively upgrading your fogs to LEDs for about the same price as doing it the wrong way (just installing led bulbs into your halogen housings)\\n\\nFor some reason I can’t post links and pictures so send me a message if you’d like the pics or links.  I’ll also try to post them as a reply.',\n",

If I wanted to sell it in the future, would it fetch a little more than I high mileage car would? The chassis would have over 100,000 miles but she’s got a new heart. Lol.

It can be either open or closed (you have to get under the car and manually pry it), so recently I’ve been thinking of switching to a custom valved setup which will quiet the car for a daily and highway use, and open the pipes electronically when in “fun” mode.\\n\\nI know Monza Record’s were quite pricey in the options list and they add to the value od the overall package, but I think there are better options out there.\\n\\n1) would you opt our for a custom setup - pros/cons?\\n\\n2) any reference links - what sould I be looking at in terms of options?\\n\\nCheers guys.',\n",

It can be either open or closed (you have to get under the car and manually pry it), so recently I’ve been thinking of switching to a custom valved setup which will quiet the car for a daily and highway use, and open the pipes electronically when in “fun” mode.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I know Monza Record’s were quite pricey in the options list and they add to the value od the overall package, but I think there are better options out there.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;1) would you opt our for a custom setup - pros/cons?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;2) any reference links - what sould I be looking at in terms of options?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Cheers guys.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

I know it's a long shot, but I was wondering if there was anyone here near Indy (Garfield Park more specifically), that would be willing to go check it out and let me know if they think is even worth pursuing. Not looking for a ppi or any guarantee, just an educated eye that could let me know if it's decent, and maybe get a feel for the dealer, they don't have the most glowing reviews. Of you think you could help send me a pm and we can discuss things, including compensation. Thanks.\",\n",

I know it&amp;#39;s a long shot, but I was wondering if there was anyone here near Indy (Garfield Park more specifically), that would be willing to go check it out and let me know if they think is even worth pursuing. Not looking for a ppi or any guarantee, just an educated eye that could let me know if it&amp;#39;s decent, and maybe get a feel for the dealer, they don&amp;#39;t have the most glowing reviews. Of you think you could help send me a pm and we can discuss things, including compensation. Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

Might order a professionally done replacement when this wears out, but for now I'm pretty happy.\n",

      "Author: jkbenn02\n",
      "Text: TLDR: FCA part number 68228884AD uses the same brackets as Abarths. \n",
      "\n",
      "Warning…I’m used to long forum posts so forgive the rambling. Also another warning, the fogs aren’t installed yet. \n",
      "\n",
      "After successfully installing NHK Gen V bi-led headlight projector assemblies in my 2013 Abarth I wanted to complete the lighting package with proper LED fog lights. I had tried just bulbs (in the headlights) but I knew it wouldn’t provide good lighting and while also knowing that it would likely make me a menace to society riding around with light going everywhere.  At least I could confirm personally that they sucked. And they did.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I say proper because far too many people are just swapping bulbs which just isn’t right. Shitty beam patterns…regardless of how much they claim that “my $50 led bulbs are great”. 🙄trust me..they aren’t great. They may be brighter than halogens but the pattern is horrible even if you clock the bulbs in every direction. \n",
      "\n",
      "Anyways, I split the headlights via baking and installed the LED projectors in place of the original halogens using various adapters. It was a lot of work and well worth the effort. Now the  headlights are just amazing and on par with my Tesla 3 which are extremely good. I used aftermarket Depo headlights as I didn’t want to deal with the OE permaseal. It was still a painful process (hot headlights are no fun to open). At least this way I could take my time as the car still had the headlights in place. \n",
      "\n",
      "On to the main topic, the fog lights:\n",
      "\n",
      "SURELY I’m not the first person to notice this but I haven’t seen anyone else post this before. These cars have been out for over a decade and the community is pretty damn good especially when it comes to modding them. \n",
      "\n",
      "Anyways, I wanted to share this with you all. Despite all those out there claiming no replacements exist I believe I can prove otherwise. \n",
      "\n",
      "I think we can all agree that the Abarth fog assemblies have a distinctive look to them when removed. So off to eBay I went. A quick cross reference of the oe part number showed a number of the other FCA cars that used the same assembly. This gave me hope 🤣\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I backed out that part number from my search and just put “LED Fog dodge” (or other brand such as Jeep) and you will quickly see factory LED fog lights that look almost identical to the Abarth fog lights. I could have stopped there and thrown those into my bumper but I wanted something better.  So if you want LED bolt in fog lights just stop here. For around ~$60 you can’t beat them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I bought a cheap set of LED fog lights on eBay (part number 68228884AD) to compare to the Abarth’s fogs. I couldn’t tell a difference between the Abarth and Jeep brackets so I took the next step of getting Morimoto XB fog lights (part number LF620). These are marketed for all those other FCA models previously mentioned but no 500 Abarth at all but it only took me a few small leaps to make the “connection”)\n",
      "\n",
      "If going the aftermarket OE route, just install them as delivered. I can’t comment on the wiring for those but the plug looks the same between the OE abarth H11 plug and the aftermarket OE style led. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’ll be installing the Morimotos soon so I’ll update this if there are any issues. Even if some type of resistor is needed that is still not a big deal. \n",
      "\n",

Changed out the stock struts front and rear to koni yellows Front and special active rear along with lowering springs and damn these improved everything on the comfort and handling monumentally. The confidence taking the 110 freeway here on Los Angeles now is like a Disney ride with no wait times in line for a thrilling experience. Pot holes and imperfect pavement discomfort is severely reduced as well. Makes local errands like a pleasure trip.  I realize this isn't the ultimate suspension set-up, but for the dollars per smile it costs and gives it's a fantastic option for keeping budget friendly and making the car totally enjoyable. This is my 10th day with the set-up so I'll post a long term review in 6 months.\n",

      "Author: Commie-Procyon-lotor\n",
      "Text: A couple weeks ago, I noticed that my 2013 Abarth (manual transmission), would have some sort of loud droning noise that spikes up in volume at intervals. I can hear it slightly at 35 miles per hour, then it would be twice as loud at 55 MPH, and it would sound up again at 75 MPH but isn't as loud as 55. So I assumed I had uneven wear on my rear tires since I heard it closer to the rear.\n",
      "\n",
      "I went to a shop to have my tires rotated and rebalanced, and I still hear this droning towards the rear. I even noticed that as I accelerate from 50 to 60, the sound \"rolls\" from underneath the seat to the rear.\n",
      "\n",
      "This droning noise even happens while I'm out of gear and the engine is at 1000RPM in highway speed and I don't hear sputtering/popping at all, so I don't think this is an exhaust leak.\n",
      "\n",
      "I assume its from damage from debris on the road, but it's so hard to tell.\n",

      "It all started with a \"random multicylinder misfire\" that ended in replacing the engine. Shortly after that, the oil cooler/filter section broke off while driving (pretty sure this was just my fault trying to get a stuck oil filter cap off and applied too much force). Replacing those broken parts required removing the transmission and replacing the oil pan as well. After we got it all back together, it wouldn't start, then bad weather hit and it had to sit for a while. This weekend, after enough cranking to re-prime the fuel pump, it started! Aaaand, proceeded to dump most of the transmission fluid on the ground due to a bad seal on the transmission cooler. Replaced that, refilled the transmission (it's a PITA on the Automatics) and was able to drive it around the neighborhood without incident! Still need to put the front bumper back on and then get it inspected, but we're closer than we've been in a while!\n",

Not looking for a ppi or any guarantee, just an educated eye that could let me know if it's decent, and maybe get a feel for the dealer, they don't have the most glowing reviews. Of you think you could help send me a pm and we can discuss things, including compensation. Thanks.\n",

Easiest car I ever sold, one phone call 10 mins after deciding to sell and got what I paid for it. It’s been great, one of the best cats I ever owned. I’ll be back I’m sure.\n",
